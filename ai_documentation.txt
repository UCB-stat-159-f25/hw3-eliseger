## Tools Used
- ChatGPT (GPT-5, November 2025)

## Purpose of Use
Understanding how to correctly set up and debug the MyST deployment to GitHub Pages

## Prompts

**Prompt:**  
> “How do I deploy my MyST site to GitHub Pages, and where should I put the YAML file?”  

**Output Summary:**  
ChatGPT explained how to create `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`, configure GitHub Actions, and enable Pages under the repo settings. It also helped troubleshoot build errors and verify the live URL.  


## Reflection
ChatGPT was used as a technical assistant for deployment and workflow setup guidance, not for producing or writing any of the project’s analytical content or code logic.  
All final implementations (ligotools package, tests, utils, notebook) were written and verified by me.
